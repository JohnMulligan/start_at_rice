# Start@Rice 2022 Data Viz Class

This repository contains the materials that will be used for the October 9 data visualization course in the Start@Rice program.

We will be using the example of COVID-19 excess mortality data to discuss the uses (and abuses) of exploratory data analysis, and to quickly build up a simple app that can be used to visually navigate the CDC's relevant, curated, public datasets in this area.

All reference materials (inluding the PowerPoint) are available on the Start@Rice canvas page: https://canvas.rice.edu/courses/44851/modules

Some reference materials are available in the reference_materials subfolder of this repository.

You *don't* need to know how to "code" to take this course, and you *won't* "learn to code" either :)

What you will be introduced to:

1. some basic programming moves that
	1. can be adapted to a number of use-cases and
	1. will familiarize you to the process publishing interactive data viz applications.
1. why people publish these sorts of apps
1. methods for critically thinking about
	1. interactivity
	1. data visualization
